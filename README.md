README 2 — Contractor Platform

# Manny’s Painting Company — Contractor Quote & Review Platform

A production-grade contractor operations platform that allows customers to request service quotes, upload project photos, and submit post-job reviews — while providing contractors with a secure admin dashboard to manage leads and customer feedback.

The platform replaces manual contractor workflows (phone calls, emails, spreadsheets) with a **structured digital pipeline for lead intake, job tracking, and reputation management**.

Built using a **modern serverless architecture** with Netlify Functions, MongoDB Atlas, and Cloudinary.

✅ These will paste cleanly into GitHub.

If you want, the next thing we should add (this is what makes your repos look senior) is:

Architecture diagrams

Admin dashboard screenshots

Case study sections

Those three things make hiring managers stop scrolling.

ur still breaking the files. if you break it again im going to end this chat and come back later because ur making this chat unnecessarily heavy.

Understood.

Here are 2 plain README.md files only. No extra formatting, no inserted IDs, no mixed content.
